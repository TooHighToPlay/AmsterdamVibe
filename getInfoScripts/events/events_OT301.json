    "description": "20:00 Introduction by Jeffrey Babcock\n20:15 Betty Blue (37\u00b02 le Matin, 1986) by Jean-Jacques Beineix, 185 min. English subtitles.\n\nBetty Blue chronicles a torrid affair between a waitress and a handyman, initially in a broken down seaside resort. Betty is both passionate and unstable, almost childlike. But as the story unfolds Betty becomes more restless and begins her descent into insanity. The same intensity that drives her love and sexuality is, ultimately, her downfall.\n\nThis is a classic story of amour fou, mad love. Both of the performances by the two main actors are absolutely haunting. Exquisitely directed by Beineix (Diva), this is an exceptionally beautiful film in terms of cinematography and mise en scene. Colour is used to breathtaking effect - the blue floors of the piano shop, the yellow car, the yellow lighting which makes it seem as though, regardless of time, it's always between afternoon or twilight. The style and mood of the film is absolutely unique and sublime....the closest it comes to is a sort of magic realism.\n\nThe soaring soundtrack by Gabriel Yared is also a classic and there was a time in the mid-80s that you could hear it playing in almost every bar you walked into in Amsterdam. A tale of love, sex and obsession not to be missed.\n\n4 euro",

    "description": "20:00 Introduction by Jeffrey Babcock\n20:15 Lacombe Lucien (FR, 1974) by L. Malle, 138 min. English subtitles.\n\nThis is a coming-of-age film by the great French director Louis Malle, but one with a deep twist. Lacombe Lucien centers on a young boy who indeed loses his innocence, but in this case the drama is set during WWII, and it follows his fate in becoming a collaborator with the German Gestapo. Let's make no mistake, even though French cinema likes to focus on the brave acts of the Resistance during the war, in reality most people collaborated with their occupier in one way or another. It was no better in Holland, actually it was even much worse.\n\nAs you might have guessed this movie was hugely controversial when it came out, it being one of the very first dramatic films to deal with the theme of collaboration. With great acting, a daring scenario, wonderful cinematography (by Tonino Delli Colli - Once upon a Time in the West) and an explosive theme, this film is not a cosy feel-good film about the war, but rather a piercing and sensitive portrayal of a life gone wrong. This movie is right up there on top with Louis Malle's very best films, and it was made at a time when he had the power to be provocative and honest with a searing intensity. An absolute must, both profound and haunting.\n\n4 euro",

Whether they play at blazing speed or temporarily slow it down for a somber ballad, they're not the ones to sing about sweet country sunshine but offer up the pure, uncut, unadulterated form \u2013 potent and dangerous and not for the faint of heart.\n\nAlthough rooted deep in American music, the Dinosaur Truckers certainly aren't just yet another folk act. This four piece band merges a wide range of styles: From fast-paced bluegrass to country, punk, rockabilly and at times even mariachi impact, they display tremendous breadth of sound and influence and deliver with giant energy.\n\nDEREK W. DUNN, former lead singer/guitarist for the late .357 String Band, returns to the stage with a solo & acoustic set. With influences ranging from Gospel to Bluegrass and from Country Blues to Rock and Roll, Dunn's material is far from \"singer-songwriter\"; rather, he exists in the jack-of-all-trades realm of the traveling folk musician - Black Country originals exist side by side with earnest Hank Williams covers; a finger-picked ballad precedes a foot-stomping explosion of Blues. With nothing more than an acoustic guitar and a broken tambourine, it's part Woody Guthrie, part Leadbelly, and part Keith Moon.",

    "description": "20:00 Introduction by Jeffrey Babcock\n20:15 Roma (1972) by Federico Fellini, 120 min. HD. English subtitles.\n\nAn epic ode to the city of Rome visualized through the sensibility of the extraordinary Italian director Federico Fellini, who of course is considered to be one of the most important artists of the last century. Fellini created several types of formula-breaking expressionistic films, and one of them is the memory-film, which is the category Roma falls into (along with Amacord). Therefore, this is a semi-autobiographical dream-movie based on Fellini's own past in the Eternal City. It took artists like Fellini to break the ice of cinema so that people like David Lynch could exist.\n\nFellini himself is seen with his crew making a documentary on the outskirts of Rome. While shooting the film, Fellini is overcome by nostalgia and memories rush forward and unleash a series of surreal and loosely connected storylines... which begin with Fellin's own arrival in Rome from his hometown of Rimini. The film continues to spiral out into many directions, but always stays firmly in touch with Fellini's deep artistic vision. Lush camerawork, wild set designs, incredible costumes and a series of surreal characters all combine to bring the story of Rome to the screen. As the opening narration goes: \"The film you are about to see does not have a story in the traditional sense with a neat plot and characters that you can follow from the beginning to the end. This pictures tells another kind of story--the story of a city.\"\n\nThe beautiful cinematography is by Giuseppe Rotunno, and the music is by Nino Rota. There are also cameos from film stars who are imbedded in Italian cinema history... like Marcello Mastroianni and Anna Magnani (in her final film appearance). A fusion of sounds and images that create a new kind of cinema... perhaps a more pure kind of cinema, based more on sensuality than storyline.\n\n4 euro",

English subtitles\n21:45 Streetwise (US, 1984) by Martin Bell, 91 min.\n\nThis film was the last of director Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki's so-called \"losers\" trilogy. It's one of the films of his career that maybe shows his special magic the best in the sense that nothing about this film should be attractive. It's about a love-starved girl, Iris, who is working on a production line in a factory, and who seems to be condemned to a life with her boring parents. The film manages to be nothing short of hypnotic and ruthlessly engaging.\n\nThis minimalist black comedy stars Kaurism\u00e4ki regular Kati Outinen, a deadly pale actress/princess whose fragility and understated acting powers are nothing short of devastating. Supposedly inspired by the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989, The Match Factory Girl is, in a way, about revolting against being trapped in any dull, lifeless and empty existence that one finds oneself stuck in. The cinematography is sharp, and the style is deadly meticulous. The cult Finnish director is in high form in this film which exudes his legendary deadpan magic.  \n\n+\n\nStreetwise  (1984)\n\nThis rare documentary is both gritty and magical at the same time. It's about kids who live on the streets, many of whom are prostitutes. The films is interestingly non-judgemental. It's hard edged but not depressing or dark... I mean, after all, Tom Waits did the soundtrack. The events we see are mind-boggling, yet feel perfectly natural at the same time. It's a film which has been almost completely forgotten about and is very difficult to see. When it is screened today its at either art museums or film festivals about the plight of the homeless. It has an austere aesthetic quality.. absolutely amazing.\n\n4 euro",

A movie director decides to blow off work and head to an off-season seaside resort with his production assistant and the PA's girlfriend, Ko Hyun-joung.

English subtitles.\n \nDastaguir and his deaf five-year-old grandson Yacine are the sole survivors of a Russian bombing raid. Their Afghan village now in ruins, Dastaguir is burdened with the task of telling his son that his wife and mother are dead. As they wait for a ride to his son\u2019s far-off coalmine, Dastaguir is haunted by fragmented yet lively memories.\n\nThese beautifully shot fragments are tragic yet compelling. For instance, Dastaguir's visions of his daughter-in-law and his wife, whose death he was unable to prevent, reveal both unexpected layers of the old man\u2019s devastating past experience and the unbearable weight of his present burden.\n\nBased on a novel director Atiq Rahimi wrote himself, Earth and Ashes pulls our attention to the universality of loss and the pervasiveness of war. Whilst devoid of political reference and without clear traces that indicate these attacks as part of the first Gulf War, Earth and Ashes can be held as a striking parallel to the gruesome invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11; a stunning portrait of loss and destruction, the film confronts us with on-going political strife in the Middle East.\n\n2,50 euro",

HD.\n22:30 Agnes From Here to There (2011) by Agn\u00e8s Varda, 45 min.\n\nAndrei Tarkovsky's first film in exile and the next to the last of his entire career, this is a brooding poetic masterpiece which explores the meaning of Russian nostalgia. Tarkovsky would never return to his homeland and this film articulates his melancholy and despair of being torn away from the things he loved. When a reporter asked Tarkovsky which country he wanted to settle in now that he left Russia, he replied \"That's like asking me which cemetery I want to bury my dead child in.\"\n\nThis film follows the journey of a Russian poet doing research in Italy and his feelings of displacement and homesickness. He finds himself attracted to the rich Italian landscape, beautifully shrouded in mist. He is attracted to his beautiful translator, but he also feels alienated at the same time. Along the way he comes across Domenico, a man who has just been released from a mental institute, and who foretells the Apocalypse. Beyond these narrative details the real core of the film is about determination, belief, endurance and responsibility.\n\n+\n\nAgnes From Here to There\n\nMade up of five 45-minute episodes, the series chronicles Agn\u00e8s Varda's travels around the world over the course of an entire year, as she examines the global art scene, meeting with different artists and filmmakers.

In spring 2014 Dutch drummer Onno Govaert joins the Help Me To Crash band. This way the group opens up a new chapter for the further development of this quartet. They all met in the fertile jazz and improvisation scene in Amsterdam where, during the last decade, they have been developing their own individual artistic pathways and shared interest about investigating a performance with free improvised music and free improvised dance. The performers are seeking for an unique language that is personal and intimate, looking for expression that is firm, free and rocking. How deep can we go with that? The so far experience brings focus on the borders of autonomy in the common composition, the balance between an emotional state, and sharing it with the audience as well as the role that each of the performers has.  Help Me To Crash Band is supported by trust, tenderness and rawness. The band goes for an adventure on stage and aims to make visible what lies deep while it keeps on falling.\n\n\n2. Duo by:\nMathieu Garrouste: electronic\nMathieu Calleja: drums\nThis electronic and drums duo started building their sound in the trio MetHat with Xavier Lopez  then with  T.E.E (Trashvortex Electronic Ensemble) in Paris 2007. Sound of urban lives, crack of sound, feedback, no-input in order to shape  a timeless frame.\n\nLights: Emese Csornai",
